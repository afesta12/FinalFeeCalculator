# FinalFeeCalculator
Calculates final selling fees on various selling platforms. Built using [HTML, SASS, Javascript]

Just a simple and quick fee calculator. I got tired of using online fee calculators because they have too many sections to fill in.

I'm a top rated seller on ebay, so the eBay fees correspond to top rated seller fees. If for some reason anyone else is interested
in using this, I would add a feature so the correct fee is displayed for non top rated sellers.
